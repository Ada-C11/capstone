# Swap 'n 'shop!

The "'shop" is for "Workshop."

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this exercise, you should:

- practice how to talk about your capstone ideas
- seen what areas need more thought
- practice how to ask about other projects on a technical level
- gather ideas, support, and reinforcement for capstone

## Directions

Follow the directions from your instructor on how you find a pair, for how much time you two will meet, and when you switch. One-on-one, use the information below to guide your conversations.

### Keep it light!

It's unlikely that everybody has their details all figured out. Keep things encouraging, positive, and light! Acknowledge how cool each other's projects are.

Take notes, ask questions, be invested in each other's successes, and let these be conversations that people grow from.

### When you're presenting your concept...

Try hitting the following points:

1. Practice a fun [elevator pitch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_pitch)!
    - Why is this project exciting for you? What are you trying to get out of it?
    - What are you trying to learn?
1. Talk about what the user will know, see, feel, and get out of the product.
1. Talk about what dependencies you anticipate needing. Be as specific as you can be.
1. Talk about what you still need to figure out, and what you're uncertain on!

### When you're listening to someone's concept...

Practice active listening. When your pair is finished speaking, try to confirm the following things:

1. Do you have an understanding of what your pair is trying to accomplish? Could you repeat it back to them?
1. What does the concept, or aspects of the concept, remind you of?
1. Do you understand what inputs the product is expecting? (What does the user need to input? What data sets? What needs to be sensed? What needs to be processed?)
    - Do you think your pair has anticipated their project's dependencies accurately?
1. Do you understand what outputs the product is producing? (What does the user see? What needs to be processed? What needs to be calculated?)
    - Do you think your pair has anticipated their project's dependencies accurately?
1. Did your pair present their thoughts on the following (whether it is with a concrete strategy, an admission of more research needed, or a decision to not consider):
    - Back-end tools?
    - Databases and database tools?
    - Front-end tools?
    - APIs, if they're free, if they have the details they need, and getting API keys?
    - Libraries?
    - Data sets to scrape?
    - Deployment?
    - Testing?
    - Hardware?

## Conclusion

These conversations should be helpful and supportive as people determine more details and decisions on their projects.
